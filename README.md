### Pong
For my Sophmore project, I recreated the classic pong using DarkGDK.


### Download To Play
- Download the `pong.exe`, `png_files folder`, and `DLL Files folder`.
- Put the `pong.exe` and the `png_files folder` into the same same directory.
- Place `d3dx9_35.dll` in C:\Windows\SysWOW64
- Run the `pong.exe` file.


### Download to contribute
I followed this tuturial on how to download VS Community 2017 and DarkGDK.
[https://servicedesk.snc.edu/hc/en-us/articles/360034544854-Computer-Science-Installing-DarkGDK] (VS Community Totural)

Drag all of the pong files into sncDarkGDK2017 project.

Copy all of the code in the `main.cpp` file and paste it into `DarkGDK2017start.cpp`

Place the png_files into the sncDarkGDK2017 project.


### How To Play
