# Pong
For my Sophmore project, I recreated the classic pong using DarkGDK.

## How To Play
- Press Space Bar to start the game.
- Player 1 is the left paddle and NPC is on the right.
- Press Return to pause the game
- If the game is paused, press arrow up or down to continue.

### Download To Play
- Download the `pong.exe`, `png_files folder`, and `DLL Files folder`.
- Put the `pong.exe` and the `png_files folder` into the same same directory.
- Place `d3dx9_35.dll` in C:\Windows\SysWOW64
- Run the `pong.exe` file.
